## Introduction
This is a training project that I made to teach myself the basics of web scraping and web crawling. It is designed
to present discord servers based on searched tag and desired population. I utilized python as there are numerous well 
developed web parser libraries created for it.

Project is created with:
* Python3 version: 3.8.2
* beautifulsoup4 library version: 4.11.1
* lxml library version: 4.8.0
* requests library version: 2.27.1
##Launch
To run this project, install locally by downloading project files as Zip archive.
Ensure that you have each library and python3 installed up to or past the version 
used for this project:

```
$ cd ../Discord-server-web-scraper
$ python3 Web-srcaper.py
```

##Features
* Find any type of discord server you can think of that matches your interests
* Navigate servers using size specific filters to pick a community appropriate to your comfort level
* After finding the perfect server, go directly to their join page

##Project status
The basic functionality and educational purpose of this program has been fulfilled. At the 
moment, I am interested in allowing users to sort the servers by size in ascending or descending order.
Lastly, I want to fully implement the last feature listed in the features section.
